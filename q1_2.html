    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine the sugar, beaten egg, and sour cream together. Mix in the flour, baking soda, and salt. Blend thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half and form each half into a long roll. (Note: If your kitchen is warm, keep the half of dough you're not working with in the refrigerator.)</li>
        <li>Cut off a narrow slice of dough. Roll lightly with hands on a lightly floured board into a pencil-like strip about 7 inches long. Form into a figure "8", and pinch ends together. Place on cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

        <p>My physics teacher said that the best way to learn physics is to double-major in computer science. Then she gave us 
            the following homework problem: </p>




            <blockquote>
            <p>Write a Javascript class that models a projectile. Provide a constructor that accepts the projectile's initial velocities on 
            both the x- and y-axes. Provide also a method for getting the projectile's position at time t. </p>
            </blockquote>




            <p>I will not take a programming course until my 5th grade year, but I watched all of <img src="youtubelogo.svg" id="youtube-logo" alt="youtube">last summer and managed to piece 
            together the following solution: </p>
            
            <pre>
            class Projectile {
                constructor(velocityX, velocityY) {
                    this.velocityX = velocityX;
                    this.velocityY = velocityY;
            } 
              getPosition(t) {
                return [this.velocityX * t, -4.9 * t * t + this.velocityY * t];
              } 
            } 
            </pre>



            <p>Perhaps by the time I am in college, <img src="youtubelogo.svg" id="youtube-logo" alt="youtube">will be handing out degrees.</p>
